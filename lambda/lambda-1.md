# Lambda 1

First encounter with lambda

## Steps

1. Create a lambda function as explained [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-python.html)
    * open the **Change default execution role**
    * Let it create a role for you automatically:  
     (Create a new role with basic Lambda permissions)
2. Create the function
3. Run the function by:
    - creating a test event object
    - call the funtion from test

Cant see much?
